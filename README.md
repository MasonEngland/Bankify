## Technologies used

# To get started

once the repository is cloned make a .env file with a variable called ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and set it to a completely randomized string of characters<br>
be sure to also create an appsettings.json file that contains all the settings you need to run the application<br> 
be sure to also install any packages that are not installed.


### To run 

first you can run the C# server in anyway you really wannt  but I believe you can also run:

<br><br>

to run the flutter app in the dev mode switch to the frontend/client directory and run:
> **% flutter run**
